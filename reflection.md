- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
My class is a rover that collects rock samples and can move and fly. It has a hashtable of samples it is currently holding, which can be processed and the added to the permanent collection to bring back to earth. The length of it's legs can change between 1-3, which dictates how far it moves when it walks, and the leg size can be 0 if it is resting so it can charge (using it's solar panels). I did not implement any additional methods other than the ones listed in the interface. This assignment was fun, it was entertaining coming up with ways to use the different function names. It worked well to have a plan of what everything was going to do before I started coding so that I could refer to correct variable names and things.
